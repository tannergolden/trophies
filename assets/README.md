# 🎨 ASSETS

<a name="top"></a>

**A designated home for everything visual this project owns.**

_Empty on purpose. Yours to fill._

## 📁 What Goes Where

| Folder      | Put here                                                        |
| :---------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `branding/` | Logos, icons, colour palettes, typography specimens             |
| `images/`   | General project imagery, screenshots, product shots             |
| `docs/`     | Diagrams and figures embedded in documents under `docs/`        |
| `badges/`   | Badge artwork and the definitions a generator reads             |

`badges/` has two homes of its own: `static/` for badges committed as finished
SVGs and served straight from the repository, and `dynamic/` for the
definitions a generator reads to produce a badge when it runs. Both are empty
until that generator lands.

The first three folders are what every project needs, and `badges/` is the one
here that precedes its contents on purpose, because its shape is already
decided. Add your own - `mockups/`, `diagrams/`, `video/` - as soon as you have
something to put in them. An empty folder invented ahead of a need is a folder
nobody uses.

## 🔗 Referencing An Asset

Use a **repository-relative** path from the document doing the referencing. A
document at `docs/technical/Architecture.md` reaches a diagram here as
`../../assets/docs/ingest-pipeline.svg`, written as an image with alt text:

<!-- Shown as inline code rather than a live image: a link checker follows a
     real markdown image, and this example names a file that does not exist. -->

`![Architecture of the ingest pipeline](../../assets/docs/ingest-pipeline.svg)`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **A profile README is the exception.** It renders off-repository, where a
> relative path resolves against the viewer's page and breaks. Those need an
> absolute `raw.githubusercontent.com` URL. Everywhere else, relative wins:
> it survives a fork, a rename, and a branch.

**Always write alt text.** It is what a screen reader announces and what shows
when an image fails to load, and it is the one accessibility requirement that
costs nothing to meet.

## 🚫 What Does Not Live Here

- **Build output.** Compiled or bundled images belong in your build directory
  and stay out of version control. This folder is for sources.
- **Large binaries.** Git stores every version of a file forever. Anything past
  a megabyte or two wants Git LFS or an external host, decided before the first
  commit rather than after the clone gets slow.
- **Anything you do not have the rights to redistribute.** A repository is a
  redistribution.

**Sources here. Build output elsewhere. Alt text always.**
