**I want** [to perform some action],
**So that** [I can achieve some goal/benefit].

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

Verifiable outcomes - each one testable, none about implementation detail:

- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [outcome].
- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [outcome].
- [ ] Errors and empty states behave as specified.
