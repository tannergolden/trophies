# 📜 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TEMPLATE

<a name="top"></a>

**Bridges a design and its code - the concrete changes, their order, and how each will be verified.**

_Structured strategy. Reduced risk. Clear implementation._

> [!NOTE]
> **How to use**: copy this file to `docs/technical/plans/<short-slug>.md` (keep this template pristine) and replace the bracketed placeholders. It bridges the [Technical Design](Technical-Design.md) and the code - small enough to review, complete enough to execute.
