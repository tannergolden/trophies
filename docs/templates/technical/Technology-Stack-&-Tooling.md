# 📝 TECHNOLOGY STACK & TOOLING

<a name="top"></a>

**Recording the official ledger of our universal technology standards.**

_Standardized architecture. Modern tooling. Documented decisions._

## 🎯 Our Technology Philosophy

We adhere to a **Universal Technology Stack** philosophy. This allows for flexibility in tool selection while maintaining strict adherence to repository standards. Every choice recorded here is made with long-term maintenance, security, and developer velocity in mind.

- **Standardized Interop**: Regardless of the tool, it must integrate with our Makefile and CI standards.
- **Traceability**: Every pivot or architectural change must be recorded in this document.
- **AI-Augmented**: We leverage modern AI builders and IDEs to accelerate delivery without sacrificing quality.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Documentation is Mandatory**. Any tool or stack choice must be recorded here. If you pivot to a new tool or AI app builder, update this file immediately via a **Pull Request (PR)**.

## 🤖 AI Orchestration & IDEs

The tools used for engineering acceleration and prototyping.

| Tool Name      | Purpose                        | Strategic Note                     | Description                    |
| :------------- | :----------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| `[REPLACE_ME]` | `[Prototyping \| Development]` | `[e.g., Google AI Studio, Cursor]` | Primary AI orchestration tool. |

---

## 🏗️ Core Application Stack

The server and substrate choices for the system.

- **Backend Framework**: `[REPLACE_ME]`
- **Cloud Provider**: `[REPLACE_ME]`
- **Infrastructure Strategy**: `[Serverless | Containerized | Edge]`

---

## 💾 Persistence Store

Where the application state lives.

- **Primary Database**: `[REPLACE_ME]`
- **Asset Storage**: `[REPLACE_ME]`

---

## 🌐 User Interface Layer

The frameworks used to deliver the visual experience.

- **Web Framework**: `[REPLACE_ME]`
- **Mobile Framework**: `[REPLACE_ME]`

---

## 🧪 Quality & Delivery

The tools ensuring stability and automated promotion.

- **Unit Testing**: `[REPLACE_ME]`
- **E2E Testing**: `[REPLACE_ME]`
- **CI/CD Platform**: `[GitHub Actions (Standard)]`

## 🛠️ Repository Target Mapping

Mapping the project-specific tools to the universal repository interface (Makefile).

| Makefile Target   | Execution Logic           | Strategic Purpose                         |
| :---------------- | :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------- |
| **Setup** | `[e.g., npm ci, or make setup]` | Bootstrap the local workspace. |
| **Lint** (`lint-command`) | `[e.g., eslint .]` | Static analysis and style enforcement. |
| **Test** (`test-command`) | `[e.g., vitest run]` | Execution of the validation suite. |
| **Build** (`build-command`) | `[e.g., vite build]` | Transformation into deployable artifacts. |
| **`make deploy`** | `[e.g., terraform apply]` | Environmental promotion.                  |
