# ☁️ ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION

<a name="top"></a>

**Configured for stability. Optimized for scale.**

_Infrastructure as Code. Network Isolation. Scalable Compute._

</div>

## 🎯 Our Environment Philosophy

We treat the environment as an immutable resource defined by code. Our objective is to eliminate "environment drift" and ensure that the infrastructure supporting our application is as predictable as the code itself.

- **Isolation**: strict boundaries between environments to prevent cross-contamination.
- **Minimalism**: Provision only the resources strictly necessary for the workload.
- **Auditability**: All configuration changes are tracked via version control and state locking.

---

## 🏗️ 1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

The methodology for defining and managing the substrate.

- **Primary Tooling**: `[Terraform | CloudFormation | CDK | Pulumi]`
- **State Backbone**: `[Remote backend / S3 with DynamoDB locking / Terraform Cloud]`
- **Organization**: `[Module-based vs Monolithic stack]`

---

## 🌍 2. Networking & Traffic Control

Defining the virtual perimeter and connectivity paths.

- **Topology**: `[VPC / Virtual Network Layout]`
- **Safety Zones**: `[Public vs Private vs Database Subnets]`
- **Ingress**: `[Load Balancers | API Gateways | Firewalls]`
- **Interconnect**: `[VPN | Direct Connect | Peering]`

## 🖥️ 3. Resource Specification

Standardized compute and storage definitions.

| Category    | Specification                   | Strategy                          |
| :---------- | :------------------------------ | :-------------------------------- |
| **Sizing**  | `[Instance Types / CPU Limits]` | Right-sized for projected load.   |
| **Scaling** | `[Horizontal Auto-scaling]`     | Demand-driven elasticity.         |
| **Runtime** | `[Container Base Images]`       | Minimalist, hardened foundations. |

---

## 📦 4. Distributed Configuration

How the application consumes environment-specific state.

- **Injection Method**: `[Environment Variables | Config Maps | Secret Manager]`
- **Promotion Flow**: `[Differences between Dev, Preview, and Release]`

---

## 🚨 5. Resilience & Governance

Protecting the data and maintaining compliance.

- **Backup Frequency**: `[Chronological snapshots / Point-in-time recovery]`
- **Replication**: `[Cross-region / Cross-datacenter redundancy]`
- **Regulatory Sync**: `[Data Residency / PII encryption standards]`
