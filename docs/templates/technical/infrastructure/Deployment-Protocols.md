# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT PROTOCOLS

<a name="top"></a>

**Deployed for speed. Proven for scale.**

_Zero-downtime. Proactive monitoring. Rapid rollback._

</div>

## 🎯 Our Deployment Strategy

We prioritize stability and availability above all else. Our deployment protocols are designed to ensure that new features reach users without interruption, while providing robust safety nets for immediate recovery.

- **Immutability**: We deploy artifacts, not live code changes.
- **Observability**: No deployment is considered "done" until health metrics are verified.
- **Safety**: Every release must have a pre-validated rollback path.

## 🏗️ 1. Hosting Architecture

Describe where the application logic and assets reside.

| Attribute        | Specification  | Range Examples                     |
| :--------------- | :------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| **Compute Type** | `[REPLACE_ME]` | Containers, Serverless, VM, Edge.  |
| **Provider**     | `[REPLACE_ME]` | AWS, GCP, Vercel, On-Prem.         |
| **Topology**     | `[REPLACE_ME]` | Multi-region, Single Zone, Global. |

## 🚢 2. Release Methodology

The mechanics of transitioning traffic from old to new versions.

- **Strategy**: `[Rolling | Blue-Green | Canary]`
- **Downtime Metric**: `[Target: Zero Downtime]`
- **Post-Deploy Toggles**: `[Tooling used for Feature Flags]`

---

## 📜 3. Execution Lifecycle

The step-by-step sequence for a production-grade release.

1. **Pre-Flight**: `[Database migrations, cache warming, backups]`
2. **Trigger**: `[GitHub Action, Webhook, Manual Dispatch]`
3. **Smoke Test**: `[Automated verification of critical user journeys]`
4. **Promotion**: `[Traffic shift completion]`

---

## 📊 4. Observability & Telemetry

How we verify the health of the system post-release.

- **Aggregation**: `[Centralized Logging (ELK, CloudWatch)]`
- **Dashboards**: `[Metrics tracking Latency/Errors/Saturation]`
- **Alerting**: `[Delivery channels: Slack, PagerDuty]`

---

## ↩️ 5. Recovery & Rollback

The emergency break-glass procedure.

- **Automated Trigger**: `[e.g., Error rate > 5% for 1 minute]`
- **Manual Trigger**: `[The specific "Red Button" command]`
- **Target RTO**: `[Maximum acceptable time to recovery]`
