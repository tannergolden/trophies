# 📝 UI SETUP & ENVIRONMENT

<a name="top"></a>

**Setting up the frontend development environment.**

_Deterministic environments. Parity-first. Streamlined onboarding._

</div>

## 🎯 Our Foundation Philosophy

We believe that a developer's productivity is directly linked to the stability of their environment. Our objective is to provide a "one-command" onboarding experience that ensures parity between local development, CI, and production.

- **Reproducibility**: Environment configuration is pinned and version-controlled.
- **Simplicity**: Minimized manual setup steps through automation and scripts.
- **Consistency**: Unified tooling across the entire engineering team.

## 📋 1. Environmental Prerequisites

The foundational tools required to execute the UI lifecycle.

| Requirement         | Specification                      | Role                            | Description                     |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ |
| **Runtime/SDK**     | `[Node.js \| Flutter SDK \| JDK]`  | Core execution engine.          | Necessary runtime environment.  |
| **Package Manager** | `[NPM \| Yarn \| Maven]`           | Dependency orchestration.       | Tool for managing libraries.    |
| **IDE Plugins**     | `[ESLint \| Prettier \| Tailwind]` | Developer-experience enhancers. | Visual feedback and formatting. |

## ⬇️ 2. Installation & Dependency Logic

How to bootstrap the repository from zero.

```bash
# Standard installation directive
[REPLACE_WITH_COMMAND]
```

- **Core Framework**: `[React | Vue | SwiftUI | Jetpack Compose]`
- **Global State**: `[Redux | Pinia | Bloc]`
- **Utilities**: `[Axios | Zod | Date-fns]`

## 🔐 3. Configuration & Secrets

Managing environmental state across the client perimeter.

| Variable           | Description              | Default                 | Sensitivity       |
| :----------------- | :----------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------- |
| **`API_BASE_URL`** | The logical gateway URI. | `http://localhost:3000` | Public.           |
| **`ENV_TOKEN`**    | Scoped access token.     | `null`                  | **Confidential.** |

---

## 🚀 4. Local Development Lifecycle

The tools and commands used for daily feature engineering.

- **Start Command**: `[npm run dev | make dev]`
- **Parity Mode**: `[Internal Emulator | Mock Service Worker]`
- **Debugging**: `[Browser DevTools | IDE Debugger integration]`

---

## 📦 5. Build & Optimization Strategy

Transforming source code into production-grade artifacts.

- **Compilation**: `[Vite | Webpack | Gradle]`
- **Optimizations**: `[Tree-shaking | Image compression | Minification]`
- **Support Matrix**: `[Target Browser Engines | OS Min-Versions]`
