# 📝 STYLING & THEMING

<a name="top"></a>

**Standards for styling and theming user interfaces.**

_Design tokens. Accessible aesthetics. Purposeful motion._

</div>

## 🎯 Our Aesthetic Intent

We believe that great design is invisible. Our goal is to create interfaces that are visually harmonious, brand-aligned, and inclusive, ensuring that the visual layer enhances rather than distracts from the user's primary objectives.

- **Consistency**: Unified design tokens ensure a cohesive look and feel across platforms.
- **Inclusivity**: Accessibility is not a feature; it is a core structural requirement.
- **Clarity**: Visual hierarchy and purposeful motion guide the user's attention.

## 🎨 1. Design Token Architecture

The fundamental variables that define our visual language.

| Category         | Token Range                             | Implementation                 | Role                       | Context                    | Description                   |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :----------------------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| **Brand Colors** | `[Primary \| Secondary \| Accent]`      | CSS Variables / Theme Objects. | Visual identity core.      | Design system foundations. | Main brand aesthetic tokens.  |
| **Functional**   | `[Success \| Warning \| Error \| Info]` | Context-aware semantic colors. | User feedback indicators.  | Interaction state.         | Purpose-driven color signals. |
| **Neutrals**     | `[Surfaces \| Borders \| Backgrounds]`  | Layout foundations and depth.  | Structure and containment. | Spatial architecture.      | Balanced supporting colors.   |

- **State Support**: `[Light Mode | Dark Mode | High Contrast]`

---

## 🔡 2. Typography & Hierarchy

Defining the voice and readability of the application.

- **Font Foundations**: `[Primary Family | Monospace Family]`
- **Scaling Strategy**: `[Modular Scale | Fixed Pixel Sizes]`
- **Vertical Rhythm**: `[Line-height and paragraph spacing rules]`

---

## ♿ 3. Accessibility (a11y) Standards

Ensuring the interface is usable by everyone.

- **Target Compliance**: `[WCAG 2.1 AA (Baseline) | AAA]`
- **Interaction Rules**: `[Focus Indicators | Keyboard Traps | Screen Reader ARIA]`
- **Cognitive Load**: `[Reduced Motion support | Reading order integrity]`

---

## 📐 4. Layout & Device Adaptation

How the interface responds to different viewports and safe areas.

- **Breakpoints**: `[Mobile | Tablet | Desktop | Ultrawide]`
- **Responsive Model**: `[Fluid Layouts | Fixed Grid | Constraints]`
- **Edge cases**: `[Handling Notches | Keyboard overlap | Foldable devices]`

---

## 🧩 5. Core Atomic Components

The building blocks of our interface.

- **Action Elements**: `[Buttons: Primary, Ghost, Destructive]`
- **Data Entry**: `[Inputs: Default, Active, Error, Disabled]`
- **Containers**: `[Cards | Modals | Drawers]`

---

## 🎬 6. Motion & Interaction Design

Purposeful movement to enhance user orientation.

- **Timing Tokens**: `[Fast (100ms) | Normal (300ms) | Slow (500ms)]`
- **Easing Logic**: `[Standard Easing | Deceleration Curves]`
- **Policy**: `[Where motion is required vs. where it is prohibited]`
