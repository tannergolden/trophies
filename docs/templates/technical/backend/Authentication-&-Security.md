# 🔐 AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY

<a name="top"></a>

**Hardening the identity perimeter through identity-first security protocols.**

_Identity-first. Least privilege. Secure-by-default._

</div>

---

## 🎯 Our Security Intent

We treat authentication and authorization as foundational infrastructure. Our goal is to provide a seamless user experience while ensuring that every request is strictly verified and authorized according to the principle of least privilege.

- **Identity Integrity**: robust verification of user and service identities.
- **Granular Control**: Policy-driven access control at the resource level.
- **Continuous Auditing**: Comprehensive logging of security-sensitive events.

---

## 🛡️ 1. Authentication (AuthN)

The methodology for verifying "Who" the user or service is.

- **Primary Mechanism**: `[JWT | Session Cookie | OAuth2 | OIDC]`
- **Identity Provider**: `[Firebase Auth | Cognito | Auth0 | Managed DB]`
- **MFA Strategy**: `[TOTP | WebAuthn | Recovery Channels]`

---

## 🎫 2. Token & Session Lifecycle

Managing the duration and security of the authenticated state.

| Artifact          | Specification                      | Storage Strategy           | Description                      |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| **Access Token**  | `[Claims, TTL (e.g., 1h)]`         | Memory-only / Context.     | Short-lived identity credential. |
| **Refresh Token** | `[Rotation, Revocation]`           | `HttpOnly` Secure Cookie.  | Long-lived session persistence.  |
| **Session State** | `[Stateless \| Distributed Cache]` | Scalable state management. | Persistence model.               |

---

## 👮 3. Authorization (AuthZ)

The logic defining "What" a verified identity is permitted to do.

- **Control Model**: `[RBAC (Roles) | ABAC (Attributes) | ACLs]`
- **Enforcement Layer**: `[Middleware | Policy Engine (OPA) | DB Scopes]`
- **Default Posture**: `[Strict Deny-All]`

---

## 🔒 4. Perimeter & Transport Security

Hardening the application communication channels.

- **Encryption**: `[TLS 1.3 | Strict Certificate Management]`
- **Browser Protection**: `[Anti-CSRF Tokens | SameSite=Strict]`
- **Security Headers**: `[HSTS | Content-Security-Policy (CSP)]`

---

## 📜 5. Security Analytics & Auditing

Maintaining a traceable record of security-critical actions.

- **Loggable Events**: `[Login attempts (Success/Fail), Privilege Escalation, Data Deletion]`
- **Sensitive Handling**: `[Encryption-at-rest | PII Anonymization]`
