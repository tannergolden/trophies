# 📋 PROJECT TEMPLATES

<a name="top"></a>

**The index of copy-source templates - what each one is for and where its copies live.**

_Structured excellence. Rapid documentation. Unified standards._

</div>

---

> [!TIP]
> Use these standardized templates to bootstrap your technical work. They are designed to meet the repository's professional standards.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Where a project gives its agents instructions, these templates are binding rather than optional.** The convention is that an agent fills in the [📜 Implementation Plan](Implementation-Plan.md) to be filled in and **delivered to the user as a report before any non-trivial change**, and the other templates to be used at the moments they help the user steer - research before direction, design before build, post-mortem after failure.

## Available Templates

| [&#x1F4DD; ADR index](../adrs/Architecture-Decision-Records.md) | The register every ADR is listed in.                   | already in place; add a row per decision            |

## Fill-In Technical Standards

Every document here is one you complete: either a **fill-in standard** whose decisions are marked by `[square brackets]` - a bare `[REPLACE_ME]`, a choice list like `[REST | GraphQL | gRPC]`, or a prompt like `[why]` - or a **work-product form** whose blank sections you write under (an ADR, a post-mortem, a user story). There are no index pages, deliberately - this catalogue is the index, and a second layer of navigation carrying nobody's decisions is a file that goes stale for free. A fill-in standard's destination **mirrors its path minus `templates/`**: `docs/templates/technical/backend/API-Design-Standards.md` instantiates as `docs/technical/backend/API-Design-Standards.md`. **Living inside `docs/templates/` is what marks them all as seed content**, with no in-file directive needed. Everything in this folder is **yours from the moment the repository is generated**: nothing syncs it, nothing overwrites it, and editing a file here has no upstream consequence.

## How to Use

1. **Copy** the template to its destination above - never fill in the template file itself; your `docs/templates/` copies are seeded once and stay pristine as long as you copy rather than edit them, and the canonical originals remain in the template home (later template improvements are never re-shipped over your seeded copies, so consult upstream for the newest form).
2. **Replace** every bracketed placeholder; delete sections that genuinely don't apply.
3. **Link** the document from the pull request (or issue) it supports, so decisions stay traceable.

### 🔗 See also

> [!TIP]
> Every canonical guide is indexed in the [&#x1F4DA; Standards Index](https://github.com/tannergolden/standards/blob/Development/docs/README.md). If you rename or move a file, update every reference to it across the repository to prevent link drift.
