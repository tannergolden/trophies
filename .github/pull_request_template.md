<!--
This template becomes the body of your pull request. Fill in every section
(empty descriptions are closed); delete a line that truly does not apply or
mark it N/A.
- Title: Conventional Commit - <type>(<scope>): summary. The squash commit
  inherits it and feeds the changelog, so make it accurate.
- Branch: a short-lived <type>/<topic> (feat/*, fix/*, docs/*) into Development.
- Scope: one intent. Aim for under 300 lines and 10 files; the size labeler
  tags `size: large` past 200 changed lines and `size: extra large` past 500.
- Open as a Draft for early feedback; mark Ready for Review once CI is green.
- Never paste secrets into code, logs, or screenshots.

- **Manual steps** a reviewer can follow to reproduce the result:
  1. [step]
  2. [step]
- **Evidence** for UI or behavior changes (before -> after screenshots, recordings, or logs; redact secrets; add alt text on images):

## 💥 Risk & Rollback

Reviewer rubric (https://github.com/tannergolden/standards/blob/Development/docs/distribution/Pull-Requests-&-Code-Reviews.md):
- Blocking: Correctness (edge cases + requirement met), Security (secrets,
  least privilege), Testability (coverage matches intent).
- High: Readability. Medium: Parity with established patterns.
- Merge needs 🧪 Lint, Test & Build, 🔍 Scan for Secrets, and ✍️ DCO Sign-Off green.
- Tag feedback by intent: [BLOCKER] / [SUGGESTION] / [NIT] / [QUESTION].
