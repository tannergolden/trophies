"""Validate this repository's own configuration.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The `ci` job in `checks.yml` fails when lint, test and
build all resolve to
nothing, because a check that checked nothing must not report green. A
scaffold with no source code in it yet would trip that on its first run -
but "no source code" is not the same as "nothing to validate". Every file
that decides how this repository behaves is here from the start, and a typo
in any of them breaks something quietly.

So this is the placeholder that is not a placeholder. It runs as the
`lint-command` until you point that at your project's real linter, and what
it checks stays true afterwards.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It never looks at source code, and it knows nothing
about any language. Link checking and spelling are separate jobs in the
called workflow already; workflow semantics and security are the `lint` job.
This
covers the gap between them: the configuration files nothing else parses.

Exits non-zero on the first category with findings, listing all of them.
Annotations are emitted in GitHub's format when running under Actions, so
findings land on the file and line in the diff.
