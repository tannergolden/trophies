"""Check every stub's permission ceiling against the workflow it calls.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A caller's `permissions:` block is a CEILING, not a grant:
it caps what the called workflow may request. Ask for less than the callee
declares and the run fails at STARTUP - no job, no step, no log, nothing in
the Actions tab to read. Ask for more and you have handed a workflow scopes
it never said it needed.

IT READS TWO REFS, AND THAT IS THE POINT. The stubs pin `@v1`, so the check
resolves them against `v1` - the code that actually runs. But `v1` is a
MOVING tag, so the same commit can pass at one moment and fail at another:
push a stub that uses something newer than the current release and it fails
until the release moves. That is a true failure, but a DIFFERENT one from a
typo, so it is reported differently. The standards default branch is read
purely to tell the two apart:

    missing at v1, missing on the default branch  -> a real mistake
    missing at v1, PRESENT on the default branch  -> waiting on a release

Run it from the repository root, with the standards checked out at `v1` in
`.standards/` and optionally at its default branch in `.standards-latest/`:
