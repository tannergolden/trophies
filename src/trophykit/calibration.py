"""Where every threshold sits against real GitHub data.

The kit says "Silver" and "top 17%" and "Rare". Those words are promises
about how many people or projects reach a number, and this module is where
the promises are pinned to measurements rather than to taste.

TWO REFERENCE POPULATIONS

  profile     Located GitHub accounts: every account with a location set,
              as collected by gayanvoice/top-github-users across 138
              countries. 122,914 accounts, refreshed 2026-09-24, with each
              account's followers and its public and private contributions
              over the last year. A located account is a person who filled
              in a profile, which is the population that puts a trophy case
              on one. The median has 36 followers and 18 public
              contributions a year; 26% made none.

  repository  Public, non-fork repositories with at least one star,
              measured through GitHub's API by src/calibrate.py and read
              from data/calibration/repositories.json at import. Stars
              and forks are counted exactly by the search API; the other
              cores come from a sample stratified by star band and
              weighted by each band's population. The estimates written
              below are what the table holds until that file exists, and
              for active days, which the API cannot count: about 38
              million starred repositories, a near-Zipf star tail anchored
              by the published tallies over 100 and over 1,000 stars and
              the 2016 thousand-stars census, and one fork per seven stars.

WHAT EACH NUMBER IS

  Every core tier carries the share of its population at or above the
  threshold, and every achievement carries the share expected to earn it.
  Each figure has a basis:

    m  measured   read off the dataset directly (followers, yearly activity)
    d  derived    the dataset scaled by a stated factor (all-time commits
                  from yearly contributions; GitHub's own totals per
                  developer from the Innovation Graph)
    e  estimated  the population's shape applied to a count the dataset
                  does not hold, with the anchors named above and the
                  medians github-readme-stats uses for its ranks (commits
                  250 a year, pull requests 50, issues 25, reviews 2, stars
                  50, followers 10, all-time)

  Rarity follows the share, never the other way round:

    Common     40% or more      Uncommon   15% to 40%
    Rare        4% to 15%       Epic        1% to 4%
    Legendary   under 1%

  The tier ladder aims at the same cuts everywhere: Bronze about the top
  half, Silver the top quarter to third, Gold the top tenth, Platinum the
  top 3%, Diamond the top 1%. Stars past Diamond keep doubling the number.

The "top N%" chip interpolates between a trophy's anchors on log-log axes
and extends the last slope beyond Diamond, so a value between two tiers
reads a share between their two shares rather than a number invented for
the gap.
