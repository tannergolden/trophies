## 🎯 How Tiers Work

A **core trophy** counts something that only grows. It is cut into five tiers,
Bronze to Diamond, and the card shows progress from the tier you hold to the
next one. Past Diamond it earns a **star** each time the Diamond number
doubles, up to five.

An **achievement** is earned or not. A **tiered** one is earned several times,
at each threshold listed, and the pin shows the numeral you hold. Its
**rarity** decides the metal it is drawn in. **Secret** ones show a question
mark until earned. Anything marked **heavy** reads individual commits rather
than a single count, so it runs under a budget and catches up over a week.

CALIBRATION = """A tier name and a rarity are claims about how many reach a number. Every
threshold and every rarity in this catalogue is pinned to a share of a
reference population, and each share says how it was got.

**Two reference populations.**

- **Profile mode: located GitHub accounts.** Every account with a location set,
  as collected by [`gayanvoice/top-github-users`](https://github.com/gayanvoice/top-github-users)
  across 138 countries: 122,914 accounts refreshed on 2026-09-24, each with its
  followers and its public and private contributions over the last year. A
  located account is a person who filled in a profile, which is the population
  that puts a trophy case on one. The median has 36 followers and 18 public
  contributions a year; 26% made none.
{REPOSITORY_POPULATION}

**Three kinds of number.** *Measured* is read off a dataset directly (followers,
yearly activity, and every repository-mode core the sample carries). *Derived* is a dataset scaled by a stated factor (all-time
commits as three times one year's contributions; 2.22 repositories per developer
from the Innovation Graph). *Estimated* applies the population's shape to a count
no dataset holds, using the anchors above and the medians
[`github-readme-stats`](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) uses
for its ranks (250 commits a year, 50 pull requests, 25 issues, 2 reviews, 50
stars, 10 followers).

**Rarity follows the share.** Common is 40% or more of the population, Uncommon
15% to 40%, Rare 4% to 15%, Epic 1% to 4%, Legendary under 1%. The tier ladder
aims at the same cuts for every trophy: Bronze about the top half, Silver the
top quarter to third, Gold the top tenth, Platinum the top 3%, Diamond the top
1%. The **Top N%** chip on a card interpolates between a trophy's anchors, so a
value between two tiers reads a share between their two shares.

The measured column is the honest one; the estimated column is a model, stated
so it can be argued with. When a better dataset turns up, the numbers move and
the words follow, in `src/trophykit/calibration.py`.
